# TILBit

Retain the information you consume. Think deeply about things you learn.

## Assumptions
-
- Quality of information is more important then quantity.
- You can only retain quality information by reflecting on it periodically.
- Timing of information is very important, but hard to pin down. The best we can do is to trigger recall often and hope it's relevant.

## Features

- Quickly add thoughts throught the command line. Supports in-line JSON metadata.
- Parse highlights done on a Kindle (via "My Clippings.txt" file)
- Support for a custom Markdown file format for TILs from one source.
