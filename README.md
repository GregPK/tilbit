# TILBit

Retain the information you consume. Think deeply about things you learn.

## Assumptions

- Quality of information is more important then quantity.
- You can only retain quality information by reflecting on it periodically.
- Timing of information is very important, but hard to pin down. The best we can do is to trigger recall often and hope it's relevant.

## Features

- Quickly add thoughts throught the command line. Supports in-line JSON metadata.
- Parse highlights done on a Kindle (via "My Clippings.txt" file)
- Support for a custom Markdown file format for TILs from one source.

## Suggestions for use

- Do not fill your database with quotes from random sources. Only add things that really spoke to you.
- Focus on your own learnings, rather than "inspiration". The goal is to make you think about the media you consume and consciously learn from it.
- Do not drown yourself with recall. Aim for one item per hour *at most*. Think about the item for *at least* 30 seconds.
- Focus in "write" rather than "read", especially in the beginning. You're instinct will be to be a consumer of data, we want to transform ourselves into being able to think crititally about what we are consuming and thinking about it deeply.
- A negative result is a result. If you haven't learned anything worthwhile, think about how you got to that particular item. What made you want to read it? How did it draw you in.
